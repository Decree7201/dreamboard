# Overview

![DreamBoard Logo](./images/dreamboard_logo.png)

DreamBoard is an AI-powered solution that generates high-quality video ads by combining AI capabilities with your brand's guidelines and creative direction. It uses a combination of the following AI products:
* Gemini for ideation and brainstorming, allowing users to generate detailed scenes descriptions and image prompts.
* Imagen for text-to-image generation or image editing using reference images.
* Veo for text-to-video and allows using seed images for image-to-video generation.

Other features include inputting brand guidelines for brand consistency, as well as using prompt rewriting and grounding techniques to refine the modelâ€™s output with realistic visuals.

The combination of the 3 AI products allows creation of ad videos from concept to storyboard to video generation.  As videos normally contain different scenes, DreamBoard allows creating videos of separate scenes, giving the user the opportunity to generate videos for that scene until it is suitable for the final video.  The scene videos are all stitched together in the end, creating the final video.  DreamBoard also includes post processing steps in the final video such as creating transitions between scenes, placement of logos and text (to be included soon).  The objective is to allow the user to be more creative by giving them greater control over each scene in the process.

# Why use DreamBoard

![DreamBoard Workflow Overview](./images/dreamboard_workflow_overview.png)

DreamBoard is a tool that can be used for quick storyboarding or end-to-end video production.   It is a tool created for AI-generated videos using a combination of Gemini, Imagen, and Veo with capabilities of:
- ad brainstorming
- prompt rewriting
- text-to-image
- text-to-video
- text-and-image-to-image
- text-and-image-to-video
- enforcing brand guidelines in image/video

It also includes extra configuration settings from the backend APIs that is mostly occluded from frontend tools, giving users more freedom to get results in the format required.

# How DreamBoard Works

DreamBoard contains a frontend and backend component.  The backend performs all the AI generation functions (text, image, video) and accessed through API calls using FastAPI.  The frontend is an Angular UI that stitches all the workflow steps together.  This decoupling allows developers who are only interested in the backend generation capabilities of DreamBoard to develop their own UI or agents while still using the DreamBoard backend.
